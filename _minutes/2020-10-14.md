**Discussion and Decisions**
* STMU/EGM:
  * Thought Machine talk on building software quickly and at scale.
	* Allie has asked that the candidates submit recordings of their speeches to ease transitions
* AlgoSIG:
  * From discussions with Optiver - particularly a Robert who leads a Masters course - they have offered the SIG access to OptiBook (a trading training platform?) under conditional circumstances they are willing to discuss.
	* Lecture confirmed for 2020-10-29 on market making.
	* Follow up call planned for 2020-10-30 to discuss access to Robert's course and so on.
	* SIG are keen to contact G-Research as well.
* ScotQuan: the committee is not able to run the SIG in the absence of its own committee, therefore we will make enquiries if there are any who would be interested in taking over but otherwise the SIG will become defunct.
* Meeting time: doodle poll posted on Slack.
* Collaboration with WiSTEM: the proposed collaboration is a series of workshops around social issues such as unconscious bias, imposter syndrome, gender identity, etc. The committee is fully in favour of this collaboration.
