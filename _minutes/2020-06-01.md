**Agenda**
* Deciding how to approach sponsorship documents
* Discussing the treasurer vacancy

**Decisions**
* Sponsorship tiers will remain largely the same, with better alignment between CompSoc tiers and HTB tiers.
* We will hold elections for treasurer during term time at an EGM.

**TODO**
* Change the sponsorship document:
  * Emphasise remote events
  * Make the gold tier wording more specific
* Find potential treasurer candidates
