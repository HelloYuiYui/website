**Discussion & Decisions**

* **Pt. 2 conclusion:** There are people running for all executive positions. We seem to be covered for next year.
* **Pt. 3 conclusion:** New sponsorship deck should include active SIGs and hybrid events. There should also be a nicer color scheme for next year. Two fintech companies are interested in sponsorships.
