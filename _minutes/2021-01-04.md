**Agenda**
* HTB update
* SIGINT finances and updates
* InfBall discussion
* Plans for the new year
* Preparing for the March elections

**Discussion and Decisions**
* 
* Crowdstrike will sponsor SIGINT for Pwned - they want to pay us through American Express, which works for our bank account. 
* They need 2-3 servers, at least one of which will be quite big, which we will help with. We need to talk to the technical secretary about this.
* SIGINT will provide a finance sheet to CompSoc in order to clarify a misunderstanding about finances and purchasing new equipment.
* We know a few people who will run for the next committee, including a presidential candidate. The old execs will need to help them with the transition.
* Potential idea: a flatmate finding system within CompSoc, especially aimed at first years who might not know enough people to move in with.
