**Present:** Alexandra Purcarea, Arty Livingstone

**Agenda**
* HTB update
* Handover preparation

**Discussion and Decisions**
* The hackathon really well, with around 50 total submissions and 300+ people in the server. It was hard to tell how participants were doing, but the livestream was fun and of really good quality. Next time, we should place more emphasis on team-building. 
* **To do for Anabel:** check out the invoice from Hack Productions, order Amazon gifts for hackathon winners with Lars (during a call), reimburse Patrick for hosting costs and Lars for Discord Nitro
* We really need to step up for promoting EGM roles. 
* The AGM will be postponed to the 2nd of April.
* We will use a similar format to the previous EGM.
* **To do for Alex:** DM people about CompSoc committee roles!
* **To do for Tudor:** promote the AGM
