**Present:** Artemis Livingstone, Karthik Narayanan, Alexandra Purcarea, Paula Sparrow, Mikey Andrejczuk, Yuto Takano, Rokas Gudavicius, Ammir Barakat

**Agenda**
* Discussing Welcome Week events


**Discussion and Decisions**
* We made a spreadsheet with our availabilities for Welcome Week events.
* **TODO for Alexandra:** Look for CompSoc merch in the cupboard, and ask Neil for extra hoodies
* **TODO for Alexandra:** Interest check for Scavengers Hunt, maybe have a cap on the event?
* Games Night and Pub Crawl might not happen in-person, and will be more difficult to organize.
* We might organize a BBQ instead of a Pub Crawl.
