  * Have a line of basic and more advanced events.
  * Coding sessions
 * Internal communication, consider using something other than slack. 
* Turing trust donation
  * Compsoc will be donating a sizeable amount of money to Turing trust from membership fees, merch etc.
  * There was also agreed to donate an amount of the money left over from HTB as well. However this was not mentioned in the HTB, money sheets etc. Needs to be pinned down by the 23rd. 
  * One idea is donating a smaller amount and use the rest for the next HTB. 
  * Another is donating a larger amount(500-1000 Pounds). The stance is that HTB is entitled to more money. 

* Finally, asking people from CompSoc to help out with HTB.
  * Patrick wants to continue what he did last year, with help form Kyle. 
 
** Votes **:
