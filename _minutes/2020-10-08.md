**Agenda**
* Discussing merchandise to send to members
* Planning the next STMU+EGM
* Deciding what to do about EUSA membership
* Talking about the new tutoring scheme
* Planning a games event for different timezones

**Decisions**
* Possible ideas for merch include: stickers, coasters, coasters, and cards. We are still discussing what to do r.e. international shipping costs.
* We need to send an email to our members about the upcoming election, as well as post on Facebook and our own website. Thought Machine will be the speaker for this STMU, and we will have a call with Allie on Sunday about production.
* The present committee unanimously decided to change membership costs to 0 pounds for all students. People who paid 1 pound for this year can get a refund.
* The committee is in favor of the tutoring scheme, and is willing to promote it.
* Having a games morning and a games night would work better than one midday event. That said, we have to see how much interest there would be for the morning event.
* Generally, we want to make sure freshers are getting to know people.

**TODO**
* Send poll to members on Discord r.e. morning game event
* Send email to members about the election
* Reach out to LastPass about getting a discount
