**Present:** Karthik N., Oscar S., Paula S., Yuto T., Mikey A.

**Agenda**
* Pt. 1: Election Discussion
* Pt. 2: Sponsors and STMU

**Discussion & Decisions**
* **Pt. 1 conclusion:** Optiver has pulled out of the 29th, but the room is booked. We'll advertise the AGM anyway.
* **Pt. 2 conclusion:** VP will ask Optiver if they'd like the 12th (mid-April) for an event. VP will also ask if Bloomberg would be fine with an online event around the end of April. May events do not look promising given many Informatics exams span the entire exam schedule, perhaps Google may not get a chance.
* **Pt. Ex:** Website has been updated to reflect the confirmation of AGM date and constitutional changes.
