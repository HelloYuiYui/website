**Discussion and Decisions**
* Voting platform - Rob Phi:
  * Democrat is an online, live platform
	* We are being granted a free trial of sorts, which when paid for includes branding and pay per credit costs.
	* Numbers are only shown in admin portal
	* We will be using the simple majority mode
	* Uses Kubernetes?
* Production costs: approximately Â£200-250 per event, but this is roughly half of what would be spent on pizza for IRL events => worth the investment.
* Donations: worth looking at, there is enough money to warrant the discussion.
  * Considerations to keep in mind include anticipating costs, hit of recession post-COVID, etc.
	* The committee as a whole agrees to not take political actions as that does not fall within the remit of CompSoc
	* Charity suggestion - Black Curriculum
	* General ideas for donating:
	  * Merchandise store
		* Talks in collaboration with other societies (eg ISOC)
		* Lump sum
		* Panel discussions - pre-recorded to maintain hygiene, Q&A style.
	* Unanimous vote in favour of donation of some sort.
