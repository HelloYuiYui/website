Mark yourself as going <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2546058098799848/">on Facebook</a> so we have enough food for you!
</p>

<p>
  If you haven't submitted a manifesto and would still like to run for election, please read <a href="https://comp-soc.com/blog/2019/03/03/march-agm.html">the elections page</a>.

  We hope you think carefully about who you choose to elect â€” please vote based on manifestos and speeches! Note that you may also vote for Ron (reopen nominations) for all positions.
</p>
<p>
  Election candidates - please remember that if you are running for President, VP, Secretary or Treasurer, your speech may be up to 2 minutes. Other roles have up to 1 minute. If you haven't bought membership yet, do that now.

<p>See you then!</p>

<p>CompSoc &lt;3 You!</p>
