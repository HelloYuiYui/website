<p>This coming Friday (<time datetime="2022-02-18 18:45Z">18th of February</time>) at 18:45 we have our February Student Tech Meetup! The topic is cutting edge Informatics research at UoE, featuring UoE Chancellor’s Fellow in Digital Technologies <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ppapapan/">Dr Petros Papapanagiotou</a>, and <a href="https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/svijayak/">Professor Sethu Vijayakumar <abbr title="Fellowship of the Royal Society of Edinburgh">FRSE</abbr></a>, Professor of Robotics, Founding Director at Edinburgh Centre for Robotics, and Programme Director at The Alan Turing Institute. Come along even if you are clueless, as you'll broaden your horizons on what computing can do, and it may help find your research interest or aspirations!</p>

            <summary><b>Dr Petros Papapanagiotou</b> - Marrying processes and data in socio-technical systems</summary>
            <quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                This talk will focus on the benefits of marrying processes with data, particularly in the context of socio-technical systems, including the so-called "social machines". I will present our progress on this front through a decade of research on logic-based workflow modelling and management. In this, we use formal methods to construct process models with associated "correct-by-construction" guarantees. The models are then deployed to be executed, combined with data sources, such as IoT sensors, and to provide useful analytics and insights. I will showcase applications in healthcare and manufacturing, effectively covering the full spectrum from rich theory to real-world practice.

            <summary><b>Professor Sethu Vijayakumar</b> - From Automation to Autonomy: Data-driven Machine Learning for Interactive Robotics</summary>
            <quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                This talk will briefly introduce powerful machine learning technologies ranging from robust multi-modal sensing, shared representations, scalable real-time learning and adaptation and compliant actuation that are enabling us to reap the benefits of increased autonomy while still feeling securely in control. This also raises some fundamental questions: while the robots are ready to share control, what is the optimal trade-off between autonomy and automation that we are comfortable with?
