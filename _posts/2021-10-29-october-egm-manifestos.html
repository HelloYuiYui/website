            <summary><b>Dylan Thinnes</b> - Why We Learn Languages</summary>
            <quote style="font-style: italic; display: block; padding-left: 2rem">
                Our programming languages are Turing-complete, meaning they all can solve the same problems - so why do we bother to learn more than one?<br>
                In this talk, we'll go over how programming languages shape (for better or worse) the way we think about problems.<br>
                We'll go over languages you have heard of, some that are more obscure, and even some "joke" languages, and see what they all bring to the table.
